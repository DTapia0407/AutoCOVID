## Why

I always forget to fill out this form at the beginning of the day, which produces a situation of delay and even danger when I have to use my cell phone outside the university.

Since the university does not impose any security measures on this form, anyone can fill out the form, so I decided to create a bot to do it for me. 

## How

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your RUT as 'rut' on Github Actions ENV
   1. Settings
   2. Secrets
   3. Actions
      1. New Repository Secret
         1. Name: rut
         2. Value: YOUR_RUT
3. Enjoy!
